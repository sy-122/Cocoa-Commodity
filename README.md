## Cocoa Commodity Price

This project conducts an analysis of various factors influencing cocoa commodity prices. By examining a curated dataset, we aim to identify the key variables that have a significant impact on price fluctuations.

The study focuses on the following variables:
 Temperature
 Precipitation
 US Currency Exchange Rate
 Sugar Price Data

The initial phase of the analysis involves a thorough examination of the dataset to determine the relevance of each variable to cocoa prices. Insights and observations are documented to provide a clear understanding of the underlying trends and patterns. See [cocoa_data_analysis](./cocoa_data_analysis.ipynb).

A linear regression analysis is employed to quantify the relationship between cocoa prices and the selected variables. This statistical approach helps in pinpointing the factors that are truly pertinent to our study.
Based on the results of the linear regression analysis, we proceed to forecast cocoa prices using all the identified relevant variables, with the exception of precipitation data. The forecasts are generated using robust predictive models to provide future price estimates under different scenarios.
